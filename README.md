# About the project
This is a project to notify you about cryptocurrencies (default setting: DOGE, BITCOIN, ETHEREUM). You can edit the code to support thousands of currencies, feel free to change it any way you like. I strongly recommend that you create your own API KEY on (pro api) CoinMarketCap and change the APIKEY variable within the code so that it works properly.

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `APIKEY` | `string` | **Required**. Your API key |
